% Main program for all the different variants of the method 
%
% phi is the RBF 'mq', 'gs',...
% ep(1:L) is the (constant) shape parameter for each grid
%         Note that for a one grid method ep is just given as a scalar 
% M is the number of time steps
% N(1:L) is the number of center points for each grid
% Ns is the number of uniform points where the solution is evaluated
% rg(1:2) is the range over which we are computing, typiclly [0 4]
% ctype is 'cheb' or 'uni' for the distribution of node points
% etype has the same function for the points where equations are enforced
% method{1:L} is 'qr' or 'dir' for RBF-QR or RBF-Direct for each grid
%             note only the lsml version allows different
% show is 'yes' or 'no' and tells if plots of the errors should be made
% col is the color to use for the error plots.
% Nls is _optional_. If present it indicates that least squares should be
% used.
